## Project Goal

- Displays a list of the current user's playlists
- Displays the tracks in each playlist when clicked on the playlist name
- The user may update the name and/or the tracks of the playlist (by using +/- buttons) and click "SAVE PLAYLIST". When the user selects "SAVE PLAYLIST", Jammming will save the current version of the playlist to the user's Spotify account.
